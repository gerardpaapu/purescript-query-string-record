Query String Record
--

Hi, don't use this package. I have no idea what I'm doing.

This is to test if I can write a well-typed library to write
url query strings from records.

Essentially, there's a lot of copypasta going on from
purescript-simple-json but it's all basically working.

I need to write some tests and think about how this fits into
a usable API
